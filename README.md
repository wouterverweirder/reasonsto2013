My slidedeck & demo I gave during the reasons.to elevator pitch 2013.

This is a nodejs app, running on port 80. There's an arduino board connected, with 8 LEDS (one for each car). Check out app.js to disable the arduino connection or the port of the nodejs app.

You can generate the public data (html, css, assets) with grunt.
